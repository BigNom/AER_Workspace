<!-- This is a sample Part Mapping file. This file was introduced with the addition
     of the Forward and Reflective View hatching capability. Since there is no field in 
     the Part schema today to allow a user to identify a hatch pattern for Forward and 
     Reflected views. This capability is accomplished with the part mapping file. This 
     contains a series of records. Each record has a Section Part Element the contains
     a ForwardPart Element and a ReflectedPart Element. Each of the elements has an 
     attribute family="..." and part="...". These attributes are Family and Part names that
     exist in the current dataset. Entities that are extracted into the Forward view and 
     have a part assigned to them that matches the SectionPart are created using the 
     properties of the FowardPart entry. This includes symbology and hatching attributes. 
     The same is true for elements in the Reflected view. Fill attributes do not apply 
     to the foward or reflected view. -->
